# Project Auth API

Creating a site were user can sign up or login to see data, some of the data should include some data specific for the user.

-Using redux as storage for userinfo and thoughts. Projected connected with Mongo Atlas.  

## The problem
Log in and register went ok. Then had som problem to get happy thoughts using the same url for login. In the end put another url for the happy thoughts from previous project. 

Also some problem with time management this week and the project are lacking some features, as user friendly error response messages and log out function. Will have to do more work on that.
